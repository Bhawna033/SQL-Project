# SQL-Project

1) PelicanStore Analysis
This project is a mini-exploration of customer transaction data from the PelicanStore dataset using SQL. It focuses on sales performance, discounts, gender-based comparisons, and customer behavior patterns using simple and effective SQL queries.

The dataset contains transaction-level data with the following columns:

Column Name -           	Description

Customer	   -           Customer ID

Method_of_Payment -     	Payment method used

Items    -              	Number of items purchased

Discount_ -	              Discount amount offered

Sales  -                	Sales amount generated

Gender     -            	Customer gender

Marital_Status	  -      Customer’s marital status

Age	        -            Age of the customer

Project Objective:

1)Analyze total and gender-specific sales.

2)Rank customers by highest sales or discount values.

3)Understand product performance based on payment methods.

4)Discover patterns using demographic features like age, gender, and marital status.

 Insights Discovered:
 
1)Female customers had some of the highest individual sales and discounts.

2)Visa and Mastercard are frequently used by high-value customers.

3)Customers aged 28 to 54 are actively purchasing higher ticket items with higher discounts.

4)Marital status doesn’t drastically change high purchase behavior in this dataset.

2) SQL Project – Music Store Data Analysis (Chinook DB)
This SQL project is built using the Chinook Database, a digital music store dataset. The objective is to extract meaningful insights related to customer purchases, tracks sold, and invoice details by performing SQL joins across multiple tables.

 Objectives:
 
Retrieve customer names and their purchased tracks.

Practice using INNER JOINs and LEFT JOINs.

Explore relationships between Customer, Invoice, and Track.

Simulate a real-world music store purchase journey using SQL.

 What I Learned:
 
How to perform JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.

How to extract specific fields and trace purchase behavior.

How digital music store datasets are structured and analyzed.

This is a foundational project that strengthens understanding of relational databases, table joins, and customer transaction tracking. It reflects how businesses use SQL to analyze sales and user behavior.

Thankyou.
